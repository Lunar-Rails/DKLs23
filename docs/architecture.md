# DKLs23 Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of the DKLs23 threshold ECDSA
library. For API usage, see the rustdoc (`cargo doc --open`).

## Protocol Stack

The implementation follows the paper's layered design:

```
 Signing (Protocol 3.6)          DKG (Protocol 9.1 from DKLs19)
        |                                |
        v                                v
 Multiplication (Functionality 3.5)   Proofs (Schnorr, Chaum-Pedersen)
        |
        v
 OT Extension (KOS + SoftSpokenOT)
        |
        v
 Base OT (Zhou et al. endemic OT)
```

### Base OT (`utilities/ot/base.rs`)

Implements the endemic OT protocol from Zhou et al. The receiver samples a
random scalar `r` using `Scalar::random()` (not vulnerable to the Fordefi
"Devious Transfer" attack, which affects implementations that use
`Scalar::from_bytes` on untrusted input).

### OT Extension (`utilities/ot/extension.rs`)

Implements Functionality 3 from DKLs19 using:
- **KOS** corrected protocol (Fig. 10 in <https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/546.pdf>)
- **SoftSpokenOT** subfield VOLE for efficiency
- **DKLs18** transfer step (Protocol 9 from <https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/499.pdf>)
- **Fiat-Shamir** heuristic for non-interactive consistency check (reduces rounds)

The "forced-reuse" technique from DKLs23 is implemented: a single batch of Bob's
OT instances is reused across all elements of Alice's input vector.

**Security note**: OT correlations are reused across signing sessions. If the
COTe consistency check fails, the counterparty MUST be permanently banned from
all future sessions (see `AbortKind::BanCounterparty`).

### Multiplication (`utilities/multiplication.rs`)

Realizes Functionality 3.5 (Random Vector OLE) using Protocol 1 from DKLs19.
Produces correlated randomness `(a, b)` such that `a * x + b = c` where `x` is
the receiver's input. Used to compute shares of products during signing.

### Zero Shares (`utilities/zero_shares.rs`)

Functionality 3.4: produces shares of zero using committed seeds. Each pair of
parties shares a seed; the share of zero is computed as a sum of PRF evaluations
over the session ID, with signs determined by party ordering.

### Proofs (`utilities/proofs.rs`)

- **Schnorr DLog proof** with randomized Fischlin transform (R=64, L=4, T=32)
  for non-interactive proofs in the random oracle model.
- **Chaum-Pedersen proof** for equality of discrete logarithms.
- **Encryption proof** (EncProof) for the DKLs18 OT transfer step.

## Protocol Flows

### DKG (4 phases + 5 steps)

1. **Phase 1**: Sample polynomial, commit to evaluation.
2. **Phase 2**: Exchange polynomial evaluations and commitments.
3. **Phase 3**: Decommit, verify proofs, reconstruct public key via Lagrange
   interpolation in the exponent.
4. **Phase 4**: Initialize OT correlations, zero-share seeds, multiplication
   setup, and BIP-32 chain code via XOR of committed auxiliary values.

Output: `Party` struct ready for signing.

### Signing (4 phases)

1. **Phase 1** (Step 4-6): Sample instance key and inversion mask. Start
   multiplication protocol (receiver side). Commit to instance point.
2. **Phase 2** (Step 7): Compute Lagrange coefficient and key share. Run
   multiplication protocol (sender side). Transmit gamma values and instance
   point.
3. **Phase 3** (Steps 8-9): Verify commitments. Finish multiplication (receiver
   side). Aggregate instance point and verify consistency of u/v variables.
   Broadcast partial signature shares.
4. **Phase 4** (Step 10): Aggregate signature shares, compute final ECDSA
   signature, and verify.

### Refresh

Two variants: full refresh (re-runs DKG-like setup) and faster refresh (updates
OT correlations using shared seeds without re-running base OT).

### Key Derivation (`protocols/derivation.rs`)

BIP-32 non-hardened derivation adapted for threshold setting. Each party derives
their share individually so the reconstructed key corresponds to BIP-32
derivation of the original master key.

### Scalar Tweaks (`protocols/tweak.rs`)

Caller-supplied additive (`k' = k + t`) and multiplicative (`k' = a·k`) tweaks on
key shares, the building blocks of Lightning per-commitment and revocation keys.
Every party applies the same tweak to its own share and the `PublicKeyPackage` is
mapped by the same function (group key and every verifying share). Because the
Lagrange coefficients used in signing sum to one, the reconstructed key moves by
exactly the tweak. OT correlations, zero-share seeds, multiplication state and the
chain code are reused unchanged — the same argument BIP-32 derivation relies on —
so a tweak is not a BIP-32 edge and leaves the derivation metadata untouched.

## Security Boundaries

### Abort Classification

Aborts are classified via `AbortKind`:
- `Recoverable`: Protocol failure, safe to retry.
- `BanCounterparty(index)`: The counterparty leaked information about reusable
  OT state. They MUST be permanently excluded from future sessions.

### Trust Model

- Messages are authenticated but not encrypted (the protocol provides its own
  confidentiality via OT).
- The orchestrator is trusted to route messages correctly.
- Party indices must be in `[1, share_count]` and are validated at signing entry.

### Zeroization

Secret material (key shares, OT correlations, multiplication state) is
automatically zeroed on drop via the `zeroize` crate.
